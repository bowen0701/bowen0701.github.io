I am Bowen Li, a data scientist and hybrid of researcher and engineer, enjoying solving business/engineering data science problems and building machine learning systems with real-world datasets. My work is to apply, tailor and implement machine learning algorithms and statistical inference, and build large-scale data processing pipelines and machine learning products. I have a PhD in Statistics from National Chiao Tung University.

I just joined [Zalando](https://en.zalando.de/) as a data scientist working on machine learning algorithms/engineering in Personalization Engine; for the brief CV please refer to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowenli0701/). The best email address to contact me is bowen0701 at gmail.com.
