I am Bowen Li, a data scientist and hybird of researcher/engineer, enjoying breaking down business/engineering problems and finding solutions using statistical machine learning with real-world datasets. My work is to apply, tailor and implement algorithms and build large-scale data processing pipelines and machine learning-based products. PhD in Statistics from National Chiao Tung University.

I just joined [Zalando](www.zalando.com) as a Data Scientist working on machine learning algorithms/engineering in Personalization Engine; for the brief CV please refer to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowenli0701/). The best email address to contact me is bowen0701 at gmail.com.
