## Outline


## Introduction

The following are the main references and OJ I use:

- [Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (2009). Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd ed.](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)
- [Jordan's Berkeley CS 170 Course: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems, a.k.a. Introduction to CS Theory.](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/170-fall05/) (free). 
- [Millar and Ranum (2011). Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python, 2nd ed.](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) (free).
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

I started from Millar & Ranum (2011), it explains clearly algorithms and data structures concepts and provides implementations in Python, from which I learned a lot. Further, to deeply study these topics, I dived into Cormen et al. (2009) (the so-called CLRS) and Jordan (2005)'s lecture notes; the former is of course classic and comprehensive, containing modern algorithms and data structures concepts, theoretical foundations and pseudocodes, and the latter is a wonderful summary for the former and is lectured by a master of machine learning. Finally, Leetcode is the best source to practice.
