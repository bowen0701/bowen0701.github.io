I read an insightful Harvard Business Review article, ["How to Give a Data-Heavy Presentation"](https://hbr.org/2015/10/how-to-give-a-data-heavy-presentation), written by Alexandra Samuel, on data-heavy presentation and data visualization. The following are my notes.

## Introduction

Knowing how to develop and deliver a data-driven presentation is now a crucial skill for many professionals, since we often have to tell our colleagues a story about

- the success of a new initiative,
- the promise of a new business opportunity, or
- the imperative of a change in strategy

stories that are much more compelling when they’re backed by numbers.

## Start by thinking about your audience

Who are you presenting to, and how much do they know about the topic? A good rule of thumb is to look at the legend on your charts: 

- If you can’t count on the audience knowing what each item in the legend actually refers to, you need to spend some time on setup before you get to the numbers.

## Don't let the data overtake your presentation

It’s easy to let the data overtake your presentation, so be sure you know the overall story you’re trying to tell, and use charts sparingly to support your story.

**Example:**

- Show a photo of a shopping cart, and tell people that you now know which cash register displays are most likely to yield impulse purchases;
- Then show the chart displaying the sales figures for different items.
- Follow that chart with an image or a few short bullets that emphasizes the actionable insights and implications of your data.

It’s rare that anyone will retain all the actual numbers in your presentation, so think about the words that capture the **idea**, **insight**, or **conclusion** you want them to hold onto.

## Take the time to spell out the story

As you present, remember that it takes people some time to digest a chart or data table. Take the time to spell out the story you see in the data so that it’s clear to others.

A simple statement like

> In every region except the Southwest, email outperforms phone calls as a way of generating leads; in the Northeast, 5% of emails get a response, versus only 3% of phone calls

will help people understand what they are looking at and how they’re supposed to read your chart.

Speak slower than you usually do, and consider pausing for a moment mid-chart, to allow people the time to absorb the data.

## Improve your data-driven presentations

- It will be easier for people to distinguish between on-screen categories if they’re shown in different, contrasting colors.
- Make sure your legend and data labels are printed in a large, visible font.

## Basic rules of good data visualization

Get familiar with the very basic rules of good data visualization,

- know which types of charts to use for different purposes
- if you simply can’t fit your entire chart onto a single slide in a way that is readable, it’s better to show highlights than to compromise the clarity of your data.

**Example:** A column chart that shows eight categories of clustered columns is going to be very crowded — but don’t you dare turn it into a set of pie charts instead:

- If there’s value in comparing categories, you want to keep that as a bar chart where all the categories are aligned on a single base line.
- Perhaps you don’t really need to show all eight categories — just the five most important ones.
- Or maybe you will have to break your chart into two successive slides; if so, organize your categories so that the most closely related categories are kept together on each slide.

## Finale

There is a lot of value in leaving people with a physical (or virtual) copy of your charts, so that they can look at the numbers more closely after your presentation.

Since data-driven decks and reports tend to get circulated, make sure that any charts you include can stand on their own, without you speaking to them: note

- the source of your data,
- make your legend clear, and
- annotate your charts with callouts that show people how to make sense of a specific data point ("7 in 10 customers chose the blue package").

**Conclusions:** All you need is to break down the wall that keeps math in one part of your brain, and storytelling in another.
