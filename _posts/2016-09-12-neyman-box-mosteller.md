## Jerzy Neyman

"Statistical theoryÂ needed to be motivated by its importance and usefulness for *applications*."

"We didn't have to know and match all the cases and understand all the relationships to find answers to the most important questions." -- In Morris Hansen's words.

## George Box (Statistician)

"I said [to the colonel] one day, 'You know, we really need to have a statistician look at these data because they are very variable.'"

"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful."

"Scientific research," he noted, "consisted of more than a single experiment. The scientist arrives at the experiment with a large body of prior knowledge or at least with a prior expectation of what might be the result. The study is designed to refine that knowledge, and the design depends upon what type of refinement is sought....This one experiment is part of a stream of experiments, The previous knowledge is then reconsidered in terms of both the new experiment and new analyses of the old experiments. The scientists never cease to return to older studies to refine their interpretation of them in terms of the newer studies....The procedure continues forever - there is no final *correct* solution....The sequence of scientific experiments followed by examination and reexamination of data has no end - there is no final scientific truth." -- In David Salsburg's word.

## Fred Mosteller (Statistician)

"The only way to find out what will happen when a complex system is disturbed is to disturbed the system, not merely to observe it passively."
