title: "Precious Lecture by My Data Science Advisor"

I recently obtained a precious lecture from my data science advisor; I will keep his words in mind on my way towards that goal:

"[A] general way to improve is to think constantly about how a very smart person would criticize your work as you do it, asking: 

- why did you do it that way? Why not simpler? Why not more complicated? 
- Why that metric to evaluate yourself? 
- What is the purpose of this? Is there a better way to achieve that purpose? And so on. 

It also helps to solicit that kind of feedback from your colleagues. In this way you learn to make things bulletproof."
