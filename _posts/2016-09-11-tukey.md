## John Tukey (Statistician, father of bit and Fast Fourier Transform)

"This experience [working on problems related to ordnance] provided him with many examples of statistical problems that he would investigate in future years. It also gave him a great appreciation for the nature of practical problems." -- In David Salsburg's words.

"The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard."
    
"It's better to have an approximate answer to the right question than an exact answer to the wrong one."

"He proposed a method that seemed to satisfy the engineer (recall Tukey's aphorism about the usefulness of an approximate answer to the right question). Tukey himself was not satified, however, and continued thinking about the problem. The result was the Fast Fourier Transform." -- In David Salsburg's words.

"Nothing has been too mundane for Tukey to attack with original insight, and nothing is too sacrosanct for him to question." -- In David Salsburg's words.

"If we need a short suggestion of what exploratory data analysis is, I would suggest that it is an attitude and a flexibility and some graph paper (or transparencies, or both)."

"In a world in which the price of calculation continues to decrease rapidly, but the price of theorem proving continues to hold steady or increase, elementary economics indicates that we ought to spend a larger and larger fraction of our time on calculation."
