I read a fantastic article ["Claude Shannon's Problem Solving Process"](http://www.businessinsider.com/engineer-claude-shannon-problem-solving-process-2017-7), on Business Insider, which introduced to me a Shannon's unpublished paper for lecture to his colleagues at Bell Labs: [Creative Thinking](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~naderi/Claude%20Shannon.html). 

The following are my notes on the classic paper, from which I learned a lot:

- "I think we could set down three things that are fairly necessary for scientific research or for any sort of inventing or mathematics or physics or anything along that line. I don’t think a person can get along without any one of these three."
  * "The first one is obvious - training and experience."
  * "The second thing is a certain amount of intelligence or talent. In other words, you have to have an IQ that is fairly high to do good research work.
  The first one is obvious - training and experience."
  * "[The third thing is] motivation. In other words, you have to have some kind of a drive, some kind of a desire to find out the answer, a desire to find out what makes things tick. If you don’t have that, you may have all the training and intelligence in the world, you don’t have questions and you won’t just find answers."
  * "A good scientist has a great deal of what we can call curiosity. I won’t go any deeper into it than that. He wants to know the answers. He’s just curious how things tick and he wants to know the answers to questions; and if he sees thinks, he wants to raise questions and he wants to know the answers to those."
- "[I]dea of [constructive] dissatisfaction.... we don’t like the way things are."
  * "The idea could be expressed in the words: This is OK, but I think things could be done better. I think there is a neater way to do this. I think things could be improved a little."" 
  * "In other words, there is continually a slight irritation when things don’t look quite right; and I think that dissatisfaction in present days is a key driving force in good scientists."
- "Pleasure in seeing net results or methods of arriving at results needed, designs of engineers, equipment, and so on."
  * "I get a big bang myself out of providing a theorem. If I’ve been trying to prove a mathematical theorem for a week or so and I finally find the solution, I get a big bang out of it. And I get a big kick out of seeing a clever way of doing some engineering problem, a clever design for a circuit which uses a very small amount of equipment and gets apparently a great deal of result out of it."
- "I think that good research workers apply these things unconsciously; that is, they do these things automatically."
  * They have to become second nature — you have to live inside of them. 
  * Shannon's real genius lay not in explaining how his own mind worked, but in his capacity for simplifying, taking apart, and inverting problems automatically.
- "The first one that I might speak of is the idea of simplification."
  * "probably a very powerful approach to this is to attempt to eliminate everything from the problem except the essentials; that is, cut it down to size."
  * "Almost every problem that you come across is befuddled with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and if you can bring this problem down into the main issues, you can see more clearly what you're trying to do."
  * "You may have simplified it to a point that it doesn't even resemble the problem that you started with; but very often if you can solve this simple problem, you can add refinements to the solution of this until you get back to the solution of the one you started with."
- "A very similar device is seeking similar known problems."
  * "You have a problem P here and there is a solution S which you do not know yet perhaps over here. If you have experience in the field represented, that you are working in, you may perhaps know of a somewhat similar problem, call it P', which has already been solved and which has a solution, S', all you need to do - all you may have to do is find the analogy from P' here to P and the same analogy from S' to S in order to get back to the solution of the given problem."
  * "This is the reason why experience in a field is so important that if you are experienced in a field, you will know thousands of problems that have been solved. Your mental matrix will be filled with P's and S's unconnected here and you can find one which is tolerably close to the P that you are trying to solve and go over to the corresponding S' in order to go back to the S you’re after."
  * It seems to be much easier to make two small jumps than the one big jump in any kind of mental thinking."
- "Another approach for a given problem is to try to restate it in just as many different forms as you can."
  * "Change the words. Change the viewpoint. Look at it from every possible angle. After you’ve done that, you can try to look at it from several angles at the same time and perhaps you can get an insight into the real basic issues of the problem, so that you can correlate the important factors and come out with the solution." 
  * "It’s difficult really to do this, but it is important that you do. If you don’t, it is very easy to get into ruts of mental thinking."
  * "That is the reason why very frequently someone who is quite green to a problem will sometimes come in and look at it and find the solution like that, while you have been laboring for months over it."
- "Another mental gimmick for aid in research work, I think, is the idea of generalization."
  * "Can I apply the same principle in more general ways? Can I use this same clever idea represented here to solve a larger class of problems? Is there any place else that I can use this particular thing?°"
- "Next one I might mention is the idea of structural analysis of a problem."
  * "Suppose you have your problem here and a solution here. You may have two big a jump to take. What you can try to do is to break down that jump into a large number of small jumps."
  * "Many proofs in mathematics have been actually found by extremely roundabout processes. A man starts to prove this theorem and he finds that he wanders all over the map. He starts off and prove a good many results which don’t seem to be leading anywhere and then eventually ends up by the back door on the solution of the given problem; and very often when that’s done, when you’ve found your solution, it may be very easy to simplify; that is, to see at one stage that you may have short-cutted across here and you could see that you might have short-cutted across there." 
  * "The same thing is true in design work. If you can design a way of doing something which is obviously clumsy and cumbersome, uses too much equipment; but after you’ve really got something you can get a grip on, something you can hang on to, you can start cutting out components and seeing some parts were really superfluous. You really didn’t need them in the first place."
- "Now one other thing I would like to bring out which I run across quite frequently in mathematical work is the idea of inversion of the problem."
  * "You are trying to obtain the solution S on the basis of the premises P and then you can’t do it. Well, turn the problem over supposing that S were the given proposition, the given axioms, or the given numbers in the problem and what you are trying to obtain is P. Just imagine that that were the case. Then you will find that it is relatively easy to solve the problem in that direction. You find a fairly direct route. If so, it’s often possible to invent it in small batches."
  * "Now I think the same thing can happen in design work. Sometimes I have had the experience of designing computing machines of various sorts in which I wanted to compute certain numbers out of certain given quantities.... But then I got the idea that if I inverted the problem, it would have been very easy to do - if the given and required results had been interchanged; and that idea led to a way of doing it which was far simpler than the first design. The way of doing it was doing it by feedback; that is, you start with the required result and run it back until - run it through its value until it matches the given input. So the machine itself was worked backward putting range S over the numbers until it had the number that you actually had and, at that point, until it reached the number such that P shows you the correct way."
