## What is PCA?

The motivation of PCA is to identify the most meaningful basis to re-express data which can maximize the [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR):](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) $$\sigma^2_{signal} / \sigma^2_{noise}$$.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/pca_snr.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/></div>

- Maximize the signal, measured by the magnitude of variance; large variance corresponds to interesting structure.
- Minimize redundancy (i.e. noise), measured by the magnitude of covariance.

Let the observed data be

$$
\underset{(m \times n)}X = \{x_{ij}\} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1n} \\
\vdots &        & \vdots \\ 
x_{m1} & \cdots & x_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
  x^T_{1.} \\
  \vdots \\ 
  x^T_{m.}
  \end{bmatrix}
= [x_{.1}, \cdots, x_{n}]
$$

where each row, $$x^T_{i.}$$, represents an example measured on $$n$$-dimensional features,

$$
x^T_{i.} = [x_{i1} \dots x_{in}]
$$

and each column, $$x_{.j}$$, represents normalized feature with zero means, $$E(x_{.j}) = 0$$, and variance one, $$Var(x_{.j}) = 1$$.

$$
x_{.j}= 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{1j} \\
\vdots \\ 
x_{mj}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

For notation simplicity, we also denote each row $$x^T_{i.}$$ by $$x^T_i$$.

The covariance matrix of $$X$$ is

$$
\underset{(n \times n)}{\Sigma_X} = \frac{1}{m}X^{T}X 
= \frac{1}{m}
\begin{bmatrix}
x^T_{.1} \\
\vdots \\ 
x^T_{.n}
\end{bmatrix}
[x_{.1},...,x_{.n}]
= \frac{1}{m}
\begin{bmatrix}
x^T_{.1}x_{.1} & \cdots & x^T_{.1}x_{.n} \\
\vdots     &        & \vdots \\ 
x^T_{.n}x_{.1} & \cdots & x^T_{.n}x_{.n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Our goal is to find some transformation, $$Y = f(X)$$, of X such that covariance of $$Y$$ is a *diagonal* matrix,

$$
\underset{(n \times n)}{\Sigma_Y} = \frac{1}{m}Y^{T}Y
$$

There are many transformations for diagonalizing the convariance matrix $$\Sigma_X$$, PCA arguably selects the easiest one.

### Assumptions for PCA
- Linear transformation: Let $$\underset{n \times n}E = [e_1,...,e_n]$$,

$$
Y = XE
$$

- Large variance have important structure.
- The principal components are orthogonal. 

The last assumption provides an intuitive simplification that makes PCA soluble with linear algebra decomposition techniques. 

### Eigendecomposition

The [eigendecomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix), or eigenvector decomposition, is also called the [spectral secomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem). Suppose $$Y = XE$$, its covariance matrix

$$
\Sigma_Y = \frac{1}{m}Y^TY = \frac{1}{m}(XE)^T(XE) = E^T \left(\frac{1}{m}X^TX \right)E
$$

Since $$\frac{1}{m}X^TX$$ is a *symmetric* matrix, it can be diagonalized by a matrix of orthonormal eigenvectors using the spectral decomposistion,

$$
\frac{1}{m}X^TX = VDV^T
$$

where $$D = diag(d_1,...,d_n)$$ is a diagonal matrix with rank-ordered set of eigenvalues, $$d_1 \ge d_2 \ge ... \ge d_n$$, and $$V = [v_1,...,v_n]$$ is the matrix of the corresponding eigenvectors with $$V^TV=VV^T = I$$.

*Sketch of proof:* From the spectral decomposition, for all $$j$$, we have 

$$
\frac{1}{m}X^T X v_j = d_j v_j
$$

Then we have $$\frac{1}{m}X^T X V = V D$$ which implies $$\frac{1}{m}X^T X = V D V^T$$.

*Alternative proof:* We can interpret PCA as finding a unit vector $$u$$, with $$|u| = 1$$, which maximizes variance of the projection of all example $$x_i$$'s onto $$u$$,

$$
\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (x_i^T u)^2 
= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (x_i^T u)^T (x_i^T u)
= u^T \big(\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m x_i x_i^T \big) u
$$

But let's digress a little to ask why the variance of the projection of all examples $$x_i$$'s onto $$u$$ has form like the above? First, suppose the angle between $$x_i$$ and $$u$$ is $$\theta$$, then the projection of each example $$x_i$$ onto $$u$$ is

$$
x_i' = x_i cos\theta
= x_i \frac{x_i^T u}{|x_i||u|}
= x_i \frac{x_i^T u}{|x_i|}
$$

since $$u$$ is a unit vector. Then the length of the projection of one example $$x_i$$'s onto $$u$$ is

$$
\left[ x_i'^T x_i' \right]^{1/2}
= \left[ \left( x_i \frac{x_i^T u}{|x_i|} \right)^T \left( x_i \frac{x_i^T u}{|x_i|} \right) \right]^{1/2}
= \left[ \left( \frac{x_i^T u}{|x_i|} \right) x_i^T x_i \left( \frac{x_i^T u}{|x_i|} \right) \right]^{1/2}
= \left[ \left(x_i^T u \right)^2 \right]^{1/2}
= x_i^T u
$$

since $$x_i^T x_i = |x_i|^2$$. Finally, the projection of one example $$x_i$$'s onto $$u$$ is the distance $$x_i^T u$$ from the origin.

Now let's go back to our optimization problem, we would like to solve

$$
max_u u^T \big(\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m x_i x_i^T \big) u
$$

such that $$u^T u = 1$$. Using the [lagrange multiplier method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier), the objective becomes

$$
max_u L(u, \lambda) = u^T \big(\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m x_i x_i^T \big) u - d (u^T u - 1)
$$

Take partial derivative with respect to $$u$$ we have

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial u} L(u, \lambda) = \frac{1}{m} X^T X u - d u := 0
$$

Hence, we are solving $$\frac{1}{m} X^T X u = d u$$, and the eigenvector decomposition result follows.

From the above results we can select $$E = V$$. Then since $$V^TV=VV^T = I$$, $$\Sigma_Y$$ now is a diagonal matrix

$$
\Sigma_Y = E^T \left( \frac{1}{m}X^T X \right) E
    = V^T \left( V D V^T \right) V = D
$$

Note that the eigenvalue $$d_j$$ is the variance of transformed feature $$y_j$$.

### Summary of PCA
- Substract off the mean of each feature: $$x_j \leftarrow x_j - \overline x_j$$, and divide the standard deviation: $$x_j \leftarrow x_j/\sigma_j$$
- Compute the eigenvectors of covariance matrix, $$\Sigma_X = \frac{1}{m}X^TX$$
- The ith principal components of $$X$$ is the covariance matrix $$\Sigma_X$$'s eigenvector $$v_i$$
- The ith diagonal value of the transformed covariance matrix $$\Sigma_Y$$ is the variance of $$X$$ along $$v_i$$ 

## What is SVD?
First recall the eigenvector decomposition: $$\frac{1}{m}X^T X v_j = d_j v_j$$. Define
- Singular values: square root of eigenvalue (variance) $$\lambda_j = \sqrt{d_j}$$, for $$j = 1,...,n$$.
- Matrix $$U = [ u_1,...,u_n ]$$, with $$u_j$$ defined by

$$
u_j = \frac{1}{\lambda_j}\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}X \right) v_j
$$

where $$v_j$$ is the eigenvector.

Then we have
- (1) $$U$$ is *orthonormal* matrix:
$$u_i^T u_j = 
\begin{cases} 
1, \text{if } i = j \\
0, \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
- (2) $$\lVert X v_i\rVert = \lambda_i$$

*Sketch of proof:* $$u_i^T u_j = \frac{1}{m} \left( \frac{1}{\lambda_i} X v_i \right)^T \left( \frac{1}{\lambda_j} X v_j \right) = \frac{1}{\lambda_i \lambda_j} v_i^T \frac{1}{m} X^T X v_j = \frac{1}{\lambda_i \lambda_j} v_i^T d_j v_j = \frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_i} v_i^T v_j$$. The first result follows. Further, we can obtain the second result similarly.

By rewriting we have

$$
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}X \right) v_j = \lambda_j u_j
$$

That is, normalized $$X$$ multiplied by an eigenvector $$v_j$$ of covariance of $$X$$, $$\frac{1}{m} X^T X$$, is equal to a scalar $$\lambda_j$$ times another vector, $$u_j$$.

### Matrix Version of SVD

- By constructing a new *diagonal* matrix of singular values, $$\Sigma = diag(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)$$, where $$\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge ... \ge \lambda_n$$.
- Define $$V = [v_1,...,v_n]$$ and $$U = [u_1,...,u_n]$$.

$$
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}X \right) V = U \Sigma,
\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}X = U \Sigma V^T
$$


Hence, *any* arbitrary matrix $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}X$$ can be transformed to
- an orthogonal matrix (*rotation*): $$U$$
- a diagonal matrix (*stretch*): $$\Sigma$$
- another orthogonal matrix (*second rotation*): $$V$$

## PCA and SVD
From SVD, we have

$$
\frac{1}{m} X^T X = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}X \right)^T \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}X \right)
                  = \left( U \Sigma V^T \right)^T \left( U \Sigma V^T \right) \\
                  = \left( V \Sigma U^T U \Sigma V^T \right)
                  = V \Sigma^2 V^T \equiv V D V^T
$$

That is, squared singular value is equal to variance of $$X$$ along eigenvector $$v_j$$, $$\lambda_j^2 = d_j$$.

### How Many Pricipal Components We Shall Use?
- Total variances: $$\sum_{j=1}^n \lambda_j^2$$.
- *Scree plot:* Choose the number of principal component by *elbow method.*

### Reduced Rank Approximation by SVD
Recall from SVD, 

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}X = U \Sigma V^T = \sum_{j=1}^n \lambda_j u_j v_j^T
$$

Let $$s < n = rank(X)$$. Then the reduced rank-$$s$$ least squares approximation to $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} X$$ is

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\widehat{X} = \sum_{j=1}^s \lambda_j u_j v_j^T
$$

which minimizes the [Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm),

$$
\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n \left( x_{ij} - \widehat{x}_{ij} \right)^2
= tr \left[ \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} (X - \widehat{X}) \right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} (X - \widehat{X}) \right)^T \right]
$$

over all matrices $$\widehat{X}$$ having rank no greater than $$s$$. This optimization problem can be solved using eigendecomposition as above.
