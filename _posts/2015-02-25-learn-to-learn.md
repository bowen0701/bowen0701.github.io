I ran across a fantastic talk ["Learning How to Learn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd2dtkMINIw), on Youtube, which was given by [Barbara Oakley](http://www.barbaraoakley.com/), Professor of engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. 

## Focused mode vs. diffuse mode

At first she talked about two thinking modes in our brains: focused mode vs. diffuse mode. In focused mode of thinking, you think a thought using some techqniues, for example multiplication, you previously have already learned. In the other mode of thinking, diffuse mode, you go at new ideas you have never accoutered before. She suggested that if you want to solve a really difficult problem, you have to go back and forth between these two modes of thinking, and it often takes a lot of time. During that time, relaxation process can be very important.

## Pomodoro technique

However, as many people, including myself, may know that procrastination is a habit. To handle it, she introduced one useful, at least for me, technique called the [Pomodoro technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/). Specifically, set a timer for 25 minutes and turn off all the unrelated things to our work, and then focus on our work only. When you are done, take a break and reward ourselves. Notice that when applying the Pomodoro technique you do not focus on finishing a task, but only focus on the time you spend. Then you can make subtle changes, such as gradually increasing the time to, say 30 or even 50 minutes.

## Life habits

Then she reminded us of the importance of sleep. It can clean the toxins from our brain and build up the long-term memory for new information. Traveling or taking exercises can have similar benefit. Fortunately I get enough sleep, but I do not have enough exercising, not to mention traveling. :-)

## Practice, practice and practice

She further discussed that, to acquiring some new techniques or skills, you must practice them to make the working memory, which is temporary and transient, into the long-term memory. One little trick is to chunk the raw information into small pieces and then understand them one by one. For professional learners, when learning some new knowledge they are used to develop enormous libraries of chunks. I think chunking materials into piece after piece is an extremely practical technique. I truly learned that technique when I was taking PhD-level courses or preparing my qualifications. Now I like to chunk everything when doing my own research, reading interesting papers, self-learing some useful techniques, or even programming codes.

By the way, when talking about memory, some people may think that they have poor memory. However, she said that poor memory may mean you have much potential that you are highly creative, because you would love to work hard and be persistent, and you are more flexible.

## Imposter syndrome

Interestingly, she then changed to talk about the [imposter syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), that is, people feel like they are not as great as others think, and are always afraid of being *found out*. Honestly, I have this syndrome at some level, and I face this issue by improving myself relentlessly. She consoled us by telling a truth: the imposter syndrome is common, especially for high-achieving people. Hope that in some day, I will be the one who is highly accomplished with a little imposter syndrome. :-)

## Read, reread and rereread 

Then she came back to discuss learning. She insisted that tests are the best, and you should do your homework again and again. When you finish reading and learning, recall what you just read and learn. All the above processes can make what is important into the internal knowledge. In short, read, reread and rereread.

## Explain what you learned

She further recommends that you should study judiciously with your colleagues, and explain what you have learned so ten-year old children or your grandmother can understand. I totally agree this point because, as statisticians, we should be able to explain and interpret the real problem we have, the statistical methods and machine learning techniques we propose to use or develop, and the insights extracted from data to our users.

## So good they can't ignore you

Finally, she concluded that passion is developed about what you are really good at, and that is something gets much longer to get good at it. I notice that her conclusion is exactly consistent with what [Cal Newport](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~cnewport/) always says that passion is earned. In his blog [Study Hacks](http://calnewport.com/blog/), which is one of my most favorite blogs, he debunks the long-held belief that "follow your passion" is good advice, and clarifies the deliberate practice that is needed to improve rapidly our skills. If we are [so good they can't ignore us](http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124), then we are crafting of a remarkable life.
