## [Paper: Lakhal, Rivest & Abdous (Biometrics, 2008)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25502035?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)

**Semi-competing risks data** occurs often in biomedical research, in which if the terminal event occurs first, it would censor the non-terminal event, but not vice versa. The goals are to study the **association between the non-terminal and terminal event times** and their **marginal behaviors**. This study note is to provide some details of the seminal work of Lakhal, Rivest & Abdous (Biometrics, 2008) which extends the work of [Fine, Jiang & Chappell (Bmka, 2001)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2673691) from a **gamma frailty model**, for the joint survival function of the terminal and non-terminal event times over the observable region, to a general class of [Archemedean copulas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)).
