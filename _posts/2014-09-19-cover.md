## Thomas Cover (Computer Scientist & Statistician)

"With such interests one should go take as many probability and statistics classes as possible from the stat department, plus his classes in advanced information theory, pattern recognition, (etc)."

"The best research occurs when there is a simple surprise in the understanding of what might be thought of as a deep result. After all there are not too many simple things to go around (Tom’s favorite Kolmogorov theory quantifies this). So if something is new, important, and simply explained it is rare indeed."

"Good research results should be like good jokes, crisp and surprising, you couldn’t see it coming and then it became obvious once you saw it."

"On paper wrote with a dull pencil, on the blackboard with oversize chalk. (N)ever let details get in the way of the big picture."

"Always made it clear that work and life were only worth the effort if they were both joyful and rewarding."

"Vigorous thinking is so much fun, and you can always laugh when you’re doing research."

"Your goal should be to change the way people think."
