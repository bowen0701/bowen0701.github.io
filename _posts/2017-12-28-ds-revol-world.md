Recently I was invited to give a data science introduction at my friend's company. It was a great pleasure and I enjoyed it much. Since the audience would consist of stakeholders, product managers, marketing / advertising managers, and many software engineers, I basically presented a general science lecture of data science, with title: **"The Lady Tasting Tea and Beyond - How Data Science is Revolutionizing World"** and outline:

- The 2nd Revolution in Science
- The Lady Tasting Tea
- Probability Distributions
- Magic Bell-Shaped Curve: Normal Distribution
- Hypothesis Testing & Confidence Interval Tricks
- Experimental Designs over the Muck
- Machine Learning Triumphant
- Data Science Applications Everywhere
- Anyway, Whatâ€™s Data Scientist? 

The following is my Slideshare slides linke:
