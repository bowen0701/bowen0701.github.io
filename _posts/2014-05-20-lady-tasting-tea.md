"At a summer tea party in Cambridge, England, a guest states that tea poured into milk tastes different from milk poured into tea. Her notion is shouted down by the scientific minds of the group. But one man, Ronald Fisher, proposes to scientifically test the hypothesis. There is no better person to conduct such an experiment, for Fisher is a pioneer in the field of statistics...." -- Quotes from the publisher's review.

No exaggeration - I've read the Chinese translation of the book, ["The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lady-Tasting-Tea-Revolutionized/dp/0805071342) (統計改變了世界), which is written by David Salsburg and translated by Wei-Wen Yeh (葉偉文), maybe 7 to 8 times, in the past few years. Salsburg really wrote the book with verve and wit, such that it provides so insightful reading for both non-statisticians and statisticians. Every time I read it, I feel like he was talking to me wisely, about the love of dozens of men and women who affect our modern everyday lives, for science and statistics.

However, I always feel regrettable that I've never read the original edition of The Lady Tasting Tea. I really want to read this momentous book *directly*. I think this book is important for budding statisticians, me among them, not only because we can learn some of the most important research tools: passion and intuition for statistics, from the words in the book, but also because we can mimic the author's writing style when telling stories associated with statistics or statisticians. So I bought this book this week, and began reading it during my leisure time. Now, let's enjoy reading The Lady Tasting Tea. :-)
