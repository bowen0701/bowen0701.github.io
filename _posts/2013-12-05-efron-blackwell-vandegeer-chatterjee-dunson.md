## Bradley Efron (Statistician)

"You just can't work in fields like statistics by yourself. You have to have the kind of stimulation that comes from being around smart people challenging you."

"I'm motivated by real problems. Some people, more honorably, want to do applications for the application's sake, but I've always been interested in it for statistics' sake.

"Statistics is a backward thinking. You think from the specific case, back to the general case, rather than vice versa."

"I've have many papers turned down, I usually work really hard on revisions. I try hard to rewrite and take referee seriously, but I'm never discouraged by referees not like something because sometimes it's because you may have a new idea."

"I'm a bad reader ab initio, but once I've started working on something, I want to read everything in that area."

"When you're writing, tell someone why you're doing something, not what you're doing."

"Astronomers have stars, geologists have rocks, we have science - it's the raw material statisticians work from."

"I always wished I'd made more of an attempt to communicate. Since then I've been careful about trying to write communications to my clients or collaborators in reasonable language, or at least reasonably like what they're used to think in."

## David Blackwell (Statistician)

"Basically, I’m not interested in doing research and I never have been. I’m interested in understanding, which is quite a different thing. And often to understand something you have to work it out yourself because no one else has done it."

## Sara van de Geer

"It's the faith of the statisticians that you have to know lots of about everything. You can use all kinds of math."

## Nilanjan Chatterjee (Statistician)

"I am engaged in important scientific problems."

"I have the freedom and support to pursue those problems that intellectually interest me most."

"I sit with a pen and paper and become immersed in formula: statistically formulate a new scientific problem or develop asymptotic theory for a new estimator."

"For PhD students,learn as much statistical theory and computation as you can."

"For assistant professors, develop a vision so you can identify important problems on your own: take a real interest in scientific applications and develop subject-matter expertise."

"Make you a better applied statistician and lead you to identify new methodological and theoretical topics of current interest."

"Avoid posing complex solution of applied problems, more productive to come up with simple intuitive solutions that can be grounded with some theoretical foundations."

"I have always been very independent researcher."

## David Dunson (Statistician)

"Enjoy what you are doing, be creative, and take risks in choosing what to work on."

"Enjoy the process - if you love what you are doing, then productivity and success will come naturally."

"Don't choose to work on topic A because of a bandwagon effect."

"Read the literature, go to talks on a wide variety of subjects."

"Have a skeptical eye and thoughts toward limitations of what people are currently doing and how to do something better fully motivated by applications."

"Don't get bogged down in the details of papers and seminars, but figure out a better 'big-picture' way of doing things."
