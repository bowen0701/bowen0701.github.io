## Maryam Mirzakhani (First female Fields medalist)

"It is invaluable to have a friend who shares your interests, and helps you stay motivated."

"The more I spent time on mathematics, the more excited I became."

"I started attending the informal seminar organized by Curt McMullen. Well, most of the time I couldn't understand a word of what the speaker was saying. But I could appreciate some of the comments by Curt. I was fascinated by how he could make things simple and elegant. So I started regularly asking him questions, and thinking about problems that came out of these illuminating discussions. His encouragement was invaluable. Working with Curt had a great influence on me, though now I wish I had learned more from him. By the time I graduated I had a long list of raw ideas that I wanted to explore."

"I find it fascinating that you can look at the same problem from different perspectives, and approach it using different methods."

"It’s hard to predict [what research problems and areas I am likely to explore in the future]. But I would prefer to follow the problems I start with wherever they lead me."

"I find collaboration quite exciting. I am grateful to my collaborators for all I have learned from them. But in some ways I would prefer to do both; I usually have some problems to think about on my own."

"Of course, the most rewarding part is the "Aha" moment, the excitement of discovery and enjoyment of understanding something new – the feeling of being on top of a hill and having a clear view. But most of the time, doing mathematics for me is like being on a long hike with no trail and no end in sight!"

"I find discussing mathematics with colleagues of different backgrounds one of the most productive ways of making progress."
 
"I am a slow thinker, and have to spend a lot of time before I can clean up my ideas and make progress. So I really appreciate that I didn’t have to write up my work in a rush."
 
"I am really not in a position to give advice; I usually use the career advice on Terry Tao’s web page for myself. Also, everyone has a different style, and something that works for one person might not be so great for others."
 
"I don't think that everyone should become a mathematician, but I do believe that many students don't give mathematics a real chance. I did poorly in math for a couple of years in middle school; I was just not interested in thinking about it. I can see that without being excited mathematics can look pointless and cold. The beauty of mathematics only shows itself to more patient followers."
