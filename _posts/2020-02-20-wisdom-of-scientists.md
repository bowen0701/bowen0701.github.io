## Thomas Cover (Computer Scientist, Statistician)

"With such interests one should go take as many probability and statistics classes as possible from the stat department, plus his classes in advanced information theory, pattern recognition, (etc)."

"The best research occurs when there is a simple surprise in the understanding of what might be thought of as a deep result. After all there are not too many simple things to go around (Tom’s favorite Kolmogorov theory quantifies this). So if something is new, important, and simply explained it is rare indeed."

"Good research results should be like good jokes, crisp and surprising, you couldn’t see it coming and then it became obvious once you saw it."

"On paper wrote with a dull pencil, on the blackboard with oversize chalk. (N)ever let details get in the way of the big picture."

"Always made it clear that work and life were only worth the effort if they were both joyful and rewarding."

"Vigorous thinking is so much fun, and you can always laugh when you’re doing research."

"Your goal should be to change the way people think."


## Maryam Mirzakhani (Mathematician, First Female Fields Medalist)

"It is invaluable to have a friend who shares your interests, and helps you stay motivated."

"The more I spent time on mathematics, the more excited I became."

"I started attending the informal seminar organized by Curt McMullen. Well, most of the time I couldn't understand a word of what the speaker was saying. But I could appreciate some of the comments by Curt. I was fascinated by how he could make things simple and elegant. So I started regularly asking him questions, and thinking about problems that came out of these illuminating discussions. His encouragement was invaluable. Working with Curt had a great influence on me, though now I wish I had learned more from him. By the time I graduated I had a long list of raw ideas that I wanted to explore."

"I find it fascinating that you can look at the same problem from different perspectives, and approach it using different methods."

"It’s hard to predict [what research problems and areas I am likely to explore in the future]. But I would prefer to follow the problems I start with wherever they lead me."

"I find collaboration quite exciting. I am grateful to my collaborators for all I have learned from them. But in some ways I would prefer to do both; I usually have some problems to think about on my own."

"Of course, the most rewarding part is the "Aha" moment, the excitement of discovery and enjoyment of understanding something new – the feeling of being on top of a hill and having a clear view. But most of the time, doing mathematics for me is like being on a long hike with no trail and no end in sight!"

"I find discussing mathematics with colleagues of different backgrounds one of the most productive ways of making progress."
 
"I am a slow thinker, and have to spend a lot of time before I can clean up my ideas and make progress. So I really appreciate that I didn’t have to write up my work in a rush."
 
"I am really not in a position to give advice; I usually use the career advice on Terry Tao’s web page for myself. Also, everyone has a different style, and something that works for one person might not be so great for others."
 
"I don't think that everyone should become a mathematician, but I do believe that many students don't give mathematics a real chance. I did poorly in math for a couple of years in middle school; I was just not interested in thinking about it. I can see that without being excited mathematics can look pointless and cold. The beauty of mathematics only shows itself to more patient followers."


## John Tukey (Mathematician, Statistician)

"This experience [working on problems related to ordnance] provided him with many examples of statistical problems that he would investigate in future years. It also gave him a great appreciation for the nature of practical problems." -- In David Salsburg's words.

"The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard."
    
"It's better to have an approximate answer to the right question than an exact answer to the wrong one."

"He proposed a method that seemed to satisfy the engineer (recall Tukey's aphorism about the usefulness of an approximate answer to the right question). Tukey himself was not satified, however, and continued thinking about the problem. The result was the Fast Fourier Transform." -- In David Salsburg's words.

"Nothing has been too mundane for Tukey to attack with original insight, and nothing is too sacrosanct for him to question." -- In David Salsburg's words.

"If we need a short suggestion of what exploratory data analysis is, I would suggest that it is an attitude and a flexibility and some graph paper (or transparencies, or both)."

"In a world in which the price of calculation continues to decrease rapidly, but the price of theorem proving continues to hold steady or increase, elementary economics indicates that we ought to spend a larger and larger fraction of our time on calculation."


## George Box (Statistician)

"I said [to the colonel] one day, 'You know, we really need to have a statistician look at these data because they are very variable.'"

"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful."

"Scientific research," he noted, "consisted of more than a single experiment. The scientist arrives at the experiment with a large body of prior knowledge or at least with a prior expectation of what might be the result. The study is designed to refine that knowledge, and the design depends upon what type of refinement is sought....This one experiment is part of a stream of experiments, The previous knowledge is then reconsidered in terms of both the new experiment and new analyses of the old experiments. The scientists never cease to return to older studies to refine their interpretation of them in terms of the newer studies....The procedure continues forever - there is no final *correct* solution....The sequence of scientific experiments followed by examination and reexamination of data has no end - there is no final scientific truth." -- In David Salsburg's word.


## Bradley Efron (Statistician)

"You just can't work in fields like statistics by yourself. You have to have the kind of stimulation that comes from being around smart people challenging you."

"I'm motivated by real problems. Some people, more honorably, want to do applications for the application's sake, but I've always been interested in it for statistics' sake.

"Statistics is a backward thinking. You think from the specific case, back to the general case, rather than vice versa."

"I've have many papers turned down, I usually work really hard on revisions. I try hard to rewrite and take referee seriously, but I'm never discouraged by referees not like something because sometimes it's because you may have a new idea."

"I'm a bad reader ab initio, but once I've started working on something, I want to read everything in that area."

"When you're writing, tell someone why you're doing something, not what you're doing."

"Astronomers have stars, geologists have rocks, we have science - it's the raw material statisticians work from."

"I always wished I'd made more of an attempt to communicate. Since then I've been careful about trying to write communications to my clients or collaborators in reasonable language, or at least reasonably like what they're used to think in."


## Jerzy Neyman (Statistician)

"Statistical theory needed to be motivated by its importance and usefulness for *applications*."

"We didn't have to know and match all the cases and understand all the relationships to find answers to the most important questions." -- In Morris Hansen's words.


## Fred Mosteller (Statistician)

"The only way to find out what will happen when a complex system is disturbed is to disturbed the system, not merely to observe it passively."


## David Blackwell (Statistician)

"Basically, I’m not interested in doing research and I never have been. I’m interested in understanding, which is quite a different thing. And often to understand something you have to work it out yourself because no one else has done it."


## Sara van de Geer (Mathematician, Statistician)

"It's the faith of the statisticians that you have to know lots of about everything. You can use all kinds of math."


## Nilanjan Chatterjee (Statistician)

"I am engaged in important scientific problems."

"I have the freedom and support to pursue those problems that intellectually interest me most."

"I sit with a pen and paper and become immersed in formula: statistically formulate a new scientific problem or develop asymptotic theory for a new estimator."

"For PhD students,learn as much statistical theory and computation as you can."

"For assistant professors, develop a vision so you can identify important problems on your own: take a real interest in scientific applications and develop subject-matter expertise."

"Make you a better applied statistician and lead you to identify new methodological and theoretical topics of current interest."

"Avoid posing complex solution of applied problems, more productive to come up with simple intuitive solutions that can be grounded with some theoretical foundations."

"I have always been very independent researcher."


## David Dunson (Statistician)

"Enjoy what you are doing, be creative, and take risks in choosing what to work on."

"Enjoy the process - if you love what you are doing, then productivity and success will come naturally."

"Don't choose to work on topic A because of a bandwagon effect."

"Read the literature, go to talks on a wide variety of subjects."

"Have a skeptical eye and thoughts toward limitations of what people are currently doing and how to do something better fully motivated by applications."

"Don't get bogged down in the details of papers and seminars, but figure out a better 'big-picture' way of doing things."
