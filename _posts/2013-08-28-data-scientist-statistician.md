## The death of the statistician?

Recently I read a *shocking* article, at least for me, ["The Death of the Statistician"](http://www.analyticbridge.com/profiles/blogs/the-death-of-the-statistician), posted by Vincent Granville, a co-founder of Big Data Scientist. In brief, that article claimed that statisticians will become extinct in this big data era. Surely, it has inspired lots of interesting but conflicting discussions. As a statistician, here are my few thoughts.

## Statisticians are data scientists

First, a successful group will not only consist of people with the same proneness. Diversity is one of the key factors for the creativity, productivity and enjoyment of that kind of technical team. We statisticians can build up almost the same set of skills, although, of course, may not be so good at JAVA or Hadoop like software engineers. (Actually, I'm self-learning Python now.) However, statisticians, among other experts, have more ability to develop useful and applicable statistical methods and machine learning techniques for new and really challenging problems.

Second, I would rather think that statisticians will transform, or be transformed, into members of this new big group: data scientists. In retrospect, my previous work was kind of doing data science, although we were using our *engineering* big data only. In that position, I needed to learn lots of domain knowledge from groups of engineers and cooperated with our software engineers and/or multi-disciplinary user teams to establish our own data products (i.e. engineering data analysis systems), via implementing lots of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms and data visualizations, for our company to extract insights from data, solve problems and make efficient and effective decisions. We can observe that all the tasks of my job are almost the same with that of data scientists, except that I was not doing all the technical stuffs myself, but by cooperating with groups of experts. However, as time went on, I realized that more and more domain and system expertise is just not enough for this more and more fast-changing complex world. I gradually felt that I would have to learn more, and of more importance, learn how to develop new statistical methods and machine learning techniques. That’s why I went back to graduate school to pursue a PhD in Statistics. Of course, novel technologies can create new paradigm(s) of how we live, work and think, and I totally agree that Big Data are among them. But I may say that, in many ways, Statistics can help us to more correctly, effectively and efficiently extract insights from data, solve problems and make decisions.

In conclusion, I think all the people playing (big) data are data scientists, which is a group composed of (business) domain experts, software engineers, analytical craftsmen, e.g. mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, etc, and many other specialists, e.g. musicians, psychologists, etc. Maybe cooperating with each other is a much more realistic, effective, efficient and interesting than being the one claiming he or she can acquire all the required skills and do all tasks by himself or herself. Finally, may I say “Old statisticians never die. They only transform.” (Apologies to General MacArthur. :-))
